# Recursed-Bridge
Cross-Chain Oracle for Bitcoin and Solana This project implements a cross-chain oracle that bridges Bitcoin and Solana blockchains using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The oracle monitors Bitcoin ordinals and verifies them on Solana, allowing for secure and private cross-chain communication.
